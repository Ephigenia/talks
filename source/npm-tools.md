<!-- _class: invert lead -->
## ‚öíÔ∏è [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

nvm is a version manager for node.js

----
### Why?

> nvm allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line on **all major operating systems**

- POSIX-compliant shell: sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash
- platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL
- simply install/uninstall node version(s)
- have multiple node versions installed
- pin node version used in project by adding a `.nvmrc`

## _ [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)

"modern native git hooks made easy" ‚Äì Easily setup local git commit hooks for the whole team.

---
### git hooks?

- Run one or more custom script(s) each time an [action](https://githooks.com/) occurs
- use cases:
    - lint file(s)
    - auto-format file(s)
    - run test(s)
    - build files
    - generate types
    - validate format of commit-message

---
### Setup

Install the dependency:

    npm install husky --save-dev;

Set the "prepare" script in `package.json`, install git-hooks:

    npm set-script prepare "husky install"
    npm run prepare

This will also create `.husky` directory and add it to `.gitignore`.

---
### Example: pre-push

Run a script everytime new code is pushed to a remote with the `pre-push` action:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm lint"
git add .husky/pre-push
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# <insert lint command here>
```

---
### bypass hooks

Sometimes scripts are slow and must be bypassed:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "chore: my message"
```

---
### False Positive(s)

Some dependencies are not required in the sources but are used for compilation, linting and other tasks. Those packages often are detected and are false-positives and can be ignore while also documenting why they are added:

```yaml
# .depcheck.yml
# use `npx depcheck --config .depcheck.yml`
ignores:
  # required by ngx-bootstrap
  - "bootstrap"
  # used for git hooks
  - "husky"
```

---
### Why?

- in CI reduce space used for cache(s)
- save space on machine
