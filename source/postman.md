# Postman üìÆ

> Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration."

---
## Features

![bg right 90%](https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/59-590994_postman-logo-transparent-hd-png-download.png)

- Make Request(s)
- Test
- Publish, Share & Collaborate with your Team or the Public
- Documentation
- Monitor your API Status
- Mock not yet created APIs based on API Definitions

---

## Create Requests

Build collections of requests that read, create, delete data in an API no matter if it‚Äôs a GraphQL, REST or even gRPC API.

- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD
- Query Parameters
- set Headers (including Cookies)
- Form, JSON Bodies
- upload files
- organize those requests in nested folders
- add description to parameters and variables for easy re-use

---

## Flexibility

Create a collection once, use in different environments, for different user(s) and use-cases.

- variables on different levels:
  - collections
  - environment(s)
  - global
- re-use the variables anywhere (`{{variableName}}`)

More: [Defining Variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-variables)

---

## Random Variables üîÄ

Postman uses [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) to provide a whole bunch of different randomly created variables that can be used especially in create request. 

Think of:

```json
{
    "username": "{{$randomFirstName}}-{{$randomLastName}}",
    "password": "{{$randomPassword}}"
}
```

Creating a new randomly created user each time and uses this user for subsequent requests.

More about [Dynamic Variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/variables-list/)

---
## Tests

Each requests runs Javascript Code when it‚Äôs done in order to be able to test the results. This makes it easy to add simple (and even complex) assumptions to a single request or even folders or whole collections.

Some Examples:
- valide response bodies agains certain schema(s)
- check for presence or values of header(s)
- re-use response data for later request(s)

## üèÉ Run Collection

A collection can be run alltogether and all requests and tests are executed sequentially and result in a report:

## Automation ü§ñ

[newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) is a command line tool written in nodejs which can run collections and execute it's tests:

```
npx newman run <collection-json-filename>
```
