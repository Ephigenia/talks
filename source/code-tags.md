# üè∑Ô∏è codetags

---
# Introduction

Different terms for the same thing: Task Tags, Task Comments, Todo Comments, Code-Tags.

---
# What?

Leave marks in the code for later adjustments or hints for your future readers. This can be inside of commands or the actual code f.e. Error Messages.

```typescript
try {
  dosomething
} catch (err: unknown) {
  throw new Error('FIXME: add implementation for thrown error catch block');
}
```

---
# Why?

There are several reasons why you would want to annotate the code and give it more context for later purposes or checks:

- you don‚Äôt have the time
- things that need to be done but later
- you want to provide more context
